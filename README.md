### Magento Asks

Magento started as and continues to be open source, and as such we are excited to see contributions from the community.  The suggestions listed below are ideas to get you started; but please feel free to work on whatever you feel is most important to advancing the platform. 
 
We look forward to seeing the pull requests that come from the hackathon, and will work to integrate Magento 1 updates into future releases. The content for our next release has been locked down, so we will most likely target the releases after that to incorporate your contributions.

For Magento 2, we have been, and will continue to, review and respond to pull requests on the Magento 2 repository as part of our ongoing development. While Magento 2 is under heavy development we'd ask the community to help us on the following improvements.

* [Configurable Grids](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/471) - define a grid in XML; no need for PHP.  The Magento 2 framework already supports it - just need to refactor the grids in the system.
* [Multinode Inventory](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/473) - the functionality providing support for multiple warehouses, per website and per warehouse stock management, orders processing through the drop shippers and vendors.

Thanks to Karen Baker at WebShopApps for kicking things off with a [tweet](https://twitter.com/WebShopApps/status/420989541366124544) and our community for running with it.
